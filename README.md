### Project 1 - Campus lost and found website

At present, there is no channel to gather the lost and found information on campus.
Therefore, it is meaningful and necessary to set up a lost and found website on campus to serve the teachers and students.
As far as the actual situation of Wenzhou University is concerned,
it is divided into two campuses, north and south.
The library and student activity center are located outside the campus,
and six living areas are scattered in the three campuses.
Therefore, it is very difficult to achieve the unified management of lost and found property
by hand because of the wide range of activities of students on campus.
Network management of lost and found office is very necessary.
In order to collect and hand in lost and found goods conveniently, a lost and found office can be set up in each college student union,
each student union, one-card recharge office, library and university student activity center in the campus,
and the administrator's account number can be allocated for relevant staff to upload lost and found information.
Of course, students can also publish information as ordinary users through their school numbers and passwords.
Publishing the information of finding and consulting announcements through the website,
students no longer need to go to various lost and found offices, just check the consulting announcements issued
by the administrator or students on the website, find out where your goods have been handed in,
go to that place to collect them directly; or your things have not been found yet.
Find, you can publish the details of your lost items and leave contact information,
waiting for the students to contact you through the search notice on the website.
In this way, the lost property can be retrieved or the owner can be found efficiently and quickly with less time and effort.
